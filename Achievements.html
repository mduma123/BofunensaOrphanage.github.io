                CHALLENGES</strong> 
                <br>
                *It is a challenge by not having any Funds for providing for all our programmes that’s
                makes our volunteering work very difficult.
                <br>
                *It is also very hard not to have any stipend for the volunteers
                <br>
                *We currently do not have the place of our own and the structure.
                <br>
                *The children loves sports very much but do not have sports ground and soccer boots,
                so is difficult for them to play. and spots act a as very good distraction part in their
                life.
                <br>
                *Other challenge is that we are trying to lower the high rate of unemployment in are
                community to fight poverty and crime, we wish to have skills training for both
                Genders.
